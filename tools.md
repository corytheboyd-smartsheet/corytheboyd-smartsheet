## MacOS

Software that specifically runs on MacOS-- i.e. not in the terminal, etc.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) | Remove the default keybinding in MacOS for spotlight, and set that shortcut in Alfred to open Alfred instead. Amazing tool that at the very least by default, is a better Spotlight search. Look into the power user features at your leisure |
| [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org) | After installed, [follow instructions for using the `shiftit` script](https://github.com/peterklijn/hammerspoon-shiftit) for window size/position management via keyboard shortcuts |
| [keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) | Visualize important key presses on your computer to communicate them to viewers when screen sharing |
| [Skitch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skitch-snap-mark-up-share/id425955336?mt=12) | Image annotation tool. Useful for taking screenshots, and adding visual elements to highlight something, blur out sensitive bits, etc. |

## Note Taking

Software useful for note taking.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org) | Markdown note editor and organizer. Can sync notes directires with WebDAV. Completely offline FOSS |

## Code Editor

Code editors and code editor accessories.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) | Manage JetBrains IDE installations |
| [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) | Community built VSCode binaries free of Microsoft telemetry |
| [spf13-vim](https://vim.spf13.com) | Sane code editing defaults for `vim` |

## Code Environment

Tools for managing the environment of various programming languages.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) | Use this as your Ruby version manager instead of `rvm`, and thank me later |
| [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) | Nodejs version manager |
| [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) | Golang version manager |

## Terminal

Programs that specifically run the in the terminal (which should be [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com), not the terminal program that ships with MacOS)

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) | Must-have terminal replacement that should just ship with macos at this point |
| [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) | `zsh` enhancement suite |
| [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) | The only ohmyzsh theme that you need |
| [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) | Fuzzy finder. [Install key bindings](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#key-bindings-for-command-line)https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#key-bindings-for-command-line to make `ctrl-r` recursive search UX actually good |
| [homebrew](https://brew.sh) | The MacOS package manager. Just install it, something will inevitably want you to have it installed |
| [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) | The essential `git` UI. Doesn't do everything, but the 99% it does is 100% less error prone and 100% faster than hacking together `git` commands ad-hoc |
| [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) | Similar to lazygit, a UI for running docker/compose containers. Again, doesn't do it all, but what it does is better than doing it ad-hoc |
| [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) | Mostly unnecessary if you're using `lazygit`, but can still be helpful for quickly viewing `git` history |

## Developer Tools

Other tools to aid you in the development of software.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef) | CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.<br><br>**STOP** pasting sensitive data into random online "decoder tools"--CyberChef works completely offline. |
| [regex101](https://regex101.com) | The last regular expression tester you will need. You can even share links to your regular expressions in regex101, making it dead simple for others to validate your crazy regular expressions |
| [CEL Playground](https://playcel.undistro.io) | If you find yourself editing [CEL (common expression language)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) and losing your mind, this tool will help. |
